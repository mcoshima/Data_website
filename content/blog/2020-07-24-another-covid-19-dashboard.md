Recently there have been an overwhelming number of dashboards created to display COVID-19 data, so I decided to try my hand at it as well. I created a dashboard that allows you to search for a state and look at the breakdown of cases and deaths by county as well as the long-term and short-term (past week) number of cases. You can see if your state has really "flattened the curve" yet or not. 

I used the [COVID19 R package](https://covid19datahub.io) which aggregates data from multiple sources including the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker, the New York Times, JHU CSSE and others.  

If you want to take a look at the code it can be found [here](https://github.com/mcoshima/COVID-19-Dashboard).  

Stay safe and wear your mask!
